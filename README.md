# ISS Overhead Notifier

This project is a simple Python script that notifies you via email when the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead during the nighttime based on your geographic coordinates. It utilizes two APIs - one to fetch the ISS's current position and another to determine if it's nighttime at your location.

## Features

- Checks if the ISS is passing overhead.
- Verifies if it's nighttime based on your latitude and longitude.
- Sends an email notification if the ISS is overhead during nighttime.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Update the following variables in the Python script `iss_overhead_notifier.py` with your own email credentials and geographic coordinates:
   - `MY_EMAIL`: Your email address.
   - `MY_PASSWORD`: Your email account password.
   - `MY_LAT`: Your latitude.
   - `MY_LONG`: Your longitude.

4. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python iss_overhead_notifier.py
   ```

## Usage

The script runs continuously in the background. It periodically checks if the ISS is overhead during nighttime based on your coordinates. If it detects the ISS overhead during nighttime, it sends an email notification to the provided email address.

## Dependencies

- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to the APIs.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- RESTful APIs
- SMTP protocol (for sending emails)
